 As I am a child, I have a lot of hobbies. For example, I love to play video games, like
  fortnite, minecraft, valorant, and a few other games. <br>

 Another hobby I have is I like to make food. I always want to make some sort of treat for 
  either me or for my family. I also almaost always make it with my sister so that it is easier.<br>

  The last hobby I have is I like to play the drums. I have been playing them since I
  was in grade one, and if it weren't for the caronavirus, I would have graduated the curriculum. <br>
