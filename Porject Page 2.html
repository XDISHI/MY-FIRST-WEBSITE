<p> Another hobby I have is I like to make food. I always want to make some sort of treat for either me or for my family. I also almaost always make it with my sister so that it is easier.</p><br>

<p> The last hobby I have is I like to play the drums. I have been playing them since I was in grade one, and if it weren't for the caronavirus, I would have graduated the curriculum.
